Build lookup graph
==================

This program will generate a look up graph for a set of words. 

It will work out the search tree for the search of the input array the list
of functions.

The algorithm for generating the tree is not optimised. The prune and tree
generation loops could be joined together.

It also generates some code for searching the array. 

PS: I know its a tree not a graph, but I thought that a graph was the 
answer, then realised it was a world of pain for little memory saving
so we now have a tree.



Usage:
------

buildgraph <filename> [<output_name>] [-i] [-u] [-p <some_string>]
           -i     The look-up will ignore the case of the word input.
           -u     The uncompressed table will be exported.
           -p     The \"TST_\" for the enum name will be replaced with <some_string>.
